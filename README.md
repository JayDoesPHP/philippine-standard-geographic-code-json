# Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC)

The **Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC)** is a systematic
classification and coding system for geographical locations in the Philippines.
Maintained by the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)**, it serves as the
official reference for administrative divisions, including regions, provinces,
cities, municipalities, and barangays.

## Data Structure

The PSGC database follows a hierarchical structure:

### **Regions**

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"created_at": "2023-05-02T19:38:38.000000Z",
	"updated_at": "2023-05-02T19:38:38.000000Z",
	"name": "Region I (Ilocos Region)",
	"code": "0100000000"
}
```

Each region is uniquely identified by a region code.
